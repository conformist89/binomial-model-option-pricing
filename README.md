# American Option Pricing with the Binomial Model

This repository provides a clear and educational implementation of **American option pricing** using the **Binomial model**. The project is designed for learners and practitioners interested in understanding **early exercise features** of American options through transparent, well-documented Python code.

The work is inspired by **Module 5** of the Coursera course  
[*Introduction to Financial Engineering and Risk Management*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-engineering-intro/home/info).

## ✨ What This Repository Covers

- Recombining **binomial stock price tree** construction
- CRR **up/down factors** and **risk-neutral probabilities**
- Pricing of:
  - American **call options**
  - American **put options**
  - American **call options on futures contracts**
- Explicit modeling of **early exercise decisions**
- Identification of the **earliest time step** where early exercise becomes optimal

All implementations are provided in **Jupyter notebooks** with step-by-step explanations.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Illustrated

### Early Exercise
- **American puts** may optimally be exercised early, especially when deep in the money.
- **American calls on non-dividend-paying stocks** should never be exercised early.
- **American calls on dividend-paying assets or futures** may be exercised early.
